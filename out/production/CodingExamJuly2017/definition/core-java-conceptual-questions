What is IDE?
Java IDE (for Integrated Development Environment) is a software application which enables users to more easily write and
debug Java programs. Many IDEs provide features like syntax highlighting and code completion, which help the user to code more easily.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
Eclipse, intellij, NetBeans, JDeveloper, BlueJ

Explain the entire java life cycle.
Created - memory was allocated, object placed in Eden;
Initialized - object is initialized with a value and becomes ready to be used;
In use - object is used for some period of time, until no references to it remain;
Unreachable - after there are no references to the object it enters this state, and can be collected by the GC;
Finalized - object is garbage collected and memory it occupied is freed up.

what is class?
A blueprint for creating objects.

What is object?
An entity that has state and behavior.

What is the entry point of an application?
public static void main(String[] args) {

Why main is static?
It is static so it can be accessed by other classes.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Interface: Doesn't define the implementation, you can inherit from multiple interfaces.
Abstract: Allows you to optionally implement default behaviour, you can only inherit from a single abstract class.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
No you can't. However you can create a Reference Variable of an Interface.
You cannot create instances of abstract class but you can refer to instances of derived types through the abstract type
and use the methods defined in the base abstract class.

what is Access Specifier?
public, protected, private

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Object Oriented Programming.
Abstraction: Abstraction is a process where you show only ?relevant? data and ?hide? unnecessary details of an object from the user.
Encapsulation: Encapsulation simply means binding object state(fields) and behavior(methods) together.
Inheritance: Inheritance is the object oriented programming concept where an object is based on another object.
Polymorphism: overriding and overloading.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Application Programming Interface. Names of API: AbstractList, Scanner, arraylist, linkedlist, BufferedReader, String

Does java support multiple inheritance?
No

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have two or more methods having same name, if their argument lists are different.
Happens in compile time.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. To handle exception, you can use checked exception
or unchecked exception. It can also be handled by try and catch method.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
The static keyword in Java means that the variable or function is shared between all instances of that class as it
belongs to the type, not the actual objects themselves.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Final can be used to specify its values are not to be changed.

What is final, finally and finalize?
Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.
The finally keyword is used with a try/catch block and guarantees that a section of code will be executed, even if an exception is thrown.
Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.

What is a constructor ?
A constructor in Java is a block of code similar to a method that?s called when an instance of an object is created.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
"this"  is a keyword in Java. It can be used inside the Method or constructor of  Class.

What is "super" keyword in java?
The super keyword in java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.

What is JVM stand for ?
Java virtual machine

What version of java are you using?
1.8

What is JAR stand for ?
Java Archive

What is compile time and run time?
Compile time is the time period when someone compiling any code
Run time is the time period when someone runs a piece of code

What is heap?
The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.

How java manage it's memory?
Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is immutable
StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object
StringBuilder  is same as the StringBuffer , that is it stores the object in heap and it can also be modified

What is Singleton class?
A singleton class is a class that can have only one object at a time.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database
or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Same amount of memory

Why is String Immutable in Java?
String is Immutable because of security, synchronization and is used as arguments for class loading.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
Calling one constructor from other is called Constructor chaining in Java.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
Serial garbage collector works by holding all the application threads. It is designed for the single-threaded environments.
Parallel garbage collector is the default garbage collector of the JVM. Unlike serial garbage collector, this uses multiple threads for garbage collection.

What is JIT stands for?
Just in time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Java applications are only allowed to use a limited amount of memory. This limit is specified during application startup.
To make things more complex, Java memory is separated into two different regions. These regions are called Heap space
and Permgen (for Permanent Generation)
The garbage collector is a program which runs on the Java Virtual Machine which gets rid of objects which are not being
used by a Java application anymore. It is a form of automatic memory management.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
No.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
Stack is used to store local variables and function call.
Heap is used to store objects. It doesn't matter, where the object is created in code, it is always stored in heap.
