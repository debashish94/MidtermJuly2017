Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
To store and organize information.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Traversing
Searching
Insertion
Deletion
Sorting
Merging

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Compiler Design, Operating System, Database Management System, Statistical analysis package, Numerical Analysis, Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, Simulation

what is an Array?
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Array is fixed size, ArrayList is dynamic.

what is LinkedList?
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
Array is a collection of elements having same data type with common name.
Linked list is an ordered collection of elements which are connected by links/pointers.

what is queue?
A queue is a linear list for which all insertions are made at one end of the list

what is stack?
A LIFO ordered list of objects.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO - First in First out, LIFO - Last in First out

what is the order of complexity?
N, O(N), O(N^2), O(N^3), O(N*log(N))

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
irst element of the list.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Last element of the list.

what is tree in data structure?
A tree is a data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges without having any cycle.

what is graph in data structure?
Consists of finite set of vertices or nodes together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices
for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
HashMap is non synchronized. It is not-thread safe and can't be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code.
Hashtable is synchronized. It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
RDBMS - Array
Network data model - Graph
Hierarchical data model - Trees

How HashMap works in java?
HashMap provides put(key, value) for storing and get(key) method for retrieving values from HashMap.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
What is DFS and BFS?
What is Recursion?
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
